# Neural Networks
## Usage
All training example are demonstrated in [the jupyter notebook](Training_Examples.ipynb).

Optional: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kelvinducray/neural-networks/blob/main/Training_Examples.ipynb)

## Project Goals
To demonstrate the following skills:
- [ ] A deep understanding of neural networks incl. hand coding
- [x] Proficieny with PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning 
- [ ] ...
- [ ] Clear presentation (leveraging Tensorboard, etc.)
- [x] Clear and modularised project structure
- [ ] Reproducibility (using Poetry & Colab functionality) * NOTE TO SELF * Colab integration?
- [x] Version control with git
- [ ] ...
- [ ] ...

## Models covered:
- [x] Fully Connected / MLP
- [ ] VGG
- [ ] ResNet
- [ ] ...
